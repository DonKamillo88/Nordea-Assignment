Create an Android application which can be used to search venues near the current location. The search is based on a keyword typed by the user.
The application has to use Foursquare Search API (https://developer.foursquare.com/start/search)
via REST - not with any Foursquare SDK. The found venues should be displayed using a list view where the name, address and the distance
to a venue are displayed.
 
- Get the current location of the mobile device
- Use REST API to get the search results
- Use Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture for the application
- User can define the search word and the search is triggered every time user types a letter
- Create the test cases that you consider necessary to test that your application works
